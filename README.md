Each challenge represents a problem (or set of problems) you are likely to encounter when doing real development work. You can do the single-problem challenges in any order, but the medleys build on each other.

When finished, each has a tool inside of Unity where you can check your work. On the top menu, click "Learn Unity Merging" and then click "Verify (challenge name)".

# Easy challenges

## Two objects created on the same line

**Scenario**: The team's designer has been placing NPCs in the level. The artist has placed props into the level, and they need to merge.
Your task: merge `same-line-add/props` into `same-line-add/main`

## Object created on the same line as object deleted

**Scenario**: The team's designer has been adding and removing more NPCs in the level. The artist has placed more props into the level, and they need to merge.
Your task: merge `same-line-add-remove/props` into `same-line-add-remove/main`

## Decimals nearly the same

**Scenario**: The designer has been tweaking the location of NPCs, and the artist has been tweaking the location of props.
Your task: merge `decimals-similar/props` into `decimals-similar/main`

## Easy Medley

**Scenario**: The team's designer has been tuning values and tweaking object placement.
Your task: merge `medley-easy/design-tweaks` into `medley-easy/main`

## Medium Medley 1

*Hint: If you're not certain what changes should be kept, take a look at the commit messages!*

## Medium Medley 2

*Hint: If you're not certain what changes should be kept, take a look at the commit messages! They'll tell you a lot... but maybe not everything.*

# Hard challenges

## Object slicing - Git thinks just the ID changed

## Prefab in scene: Scene-only sub-objects

## Hard Medley 1

*Hint: If you're not certain what changes should be kept, take a look at the commit messages! They'll tell you a lot... but maybe not everything.*

## Hard Medley 2

*Hint: If you're not certain what changes should be kept, take a look at the commit messages! Some will be helpful, and some won't... but it's a start.*
